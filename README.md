Deviations: 

We got most things done but one feature Abhinav struggled with is the in-app chat for group messaging: “Basic In-App Chat for Group Messaging”. There are difficulties with the implementation of firestore as well as an added learning curve for a fairly advanced feature, so we were unable to fully complete it for this release. We plan to complete this feature with the next release coming.
